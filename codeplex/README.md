===========================

Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.6 or above

STEPS:

1. Download ESB 4.9.0-ALPHA by navigating the following the URL: https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/scratch/ESB/.

2. Copy wso2esb-4.9.0-ALPHA.zip file in to location "{ESB_Connector_Home}/repository/".

3. Make sure that codeplex is specified as a module in ESB_Connector_Parent pom.

	v) By invoking getAccessToken.xml configuration, it will obtain the temporary access token using these property values. You need to invoke this operation before invoking authentication required operations.
	
	vi) More information on codeplex authentication available at codeplex online documentation site[5].

5. Following authentication information has used in integration test suite.

   Authentication parameters can be modified under following property file which will effective on all authentication required
   positive test cases.

   Copy request files to following directory.
   
   {codeplex-connector-home}/src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/config/restRequests/codeplex


		proxyDirectoryPath   = "{codeplex-connector-home}/src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/config/proxies/codeplex/"
		requestDirectoryPath = "{codeplex-connector-home}/src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/config/restRequests/codeplex/"
		clientId             = "e2ca3fc77e334c679f0c5c50257f9f36"
		clientSecret         = "44c635345fbd408d96e675b0aaf1334d"
		refreshToken         = "L4Eo!IAAAAL3yP6zFRfsriup7jYcQThecBNIpHJ4UJFfYfGKDP2MNsQAAAAHxh0bbfEjjP7RDQBsRrELlW6cZDe4sGcT5jp3jNGxSkmwUZya3qDhgcPVxOyIuj-SC0fhdc5LP8xIqOWqR1SjiDa9d29uvopFxv-da14X2i_QByD1XCKPUHie04VKVphk_q0ta9AjsXc9MrUR9a6O24U_Da9srHendD0TJJKfygjHgYvFzkO3KIcoHmG2abPHybkBOBQHyltaHJwfESYohqHqRhL_FwJfnSRJjrzq8dg"
