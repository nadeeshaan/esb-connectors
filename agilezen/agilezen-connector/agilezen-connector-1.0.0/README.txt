						<messageFormatter contentType="text/html"
									class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
						<messageBuilder contentType="text/html" 
													class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>
													
	iii) Compress the modified ESB as wso2esb-4.9.0.zip and copy that zip file in to location "<AGILEZEN_CONNECTOR_HOME>/agilezen-connector/agilezen-connector-1.0.0/org.wso2.carbon.connector/repository/".
		
 3. Create a agilezen trial account and derive the API Token.
